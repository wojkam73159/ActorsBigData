# IMDB Dataset Actors with Hadoop, MapReduce, and Pig on Google Cloud
## Overview

This project leverages the Hadoop ecosystem, specifically MapReduce and Pig, to analyze actors dataset from the IMDB. The primary goal of the project is to determine how many movies each person participated in (as either an actor or crew member) and how many movies each person directed. The project culminates in identifying the top 3 individuals with the highest participation or direction counts. The entire process was successfully deployed and executed on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).
## Tech Stack

    Java: Main programming language for the MapReduce tasks.
    Hadoop: Framework used for distributed storage and processing of large datasets.
    MapReduce: Used to process and aggregate the movie participation and direction counts.
    Apache Pig: High-level platform for querying and transforming the data.
    Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Cloud infrastructure for running Hadoop jobs and handling large datasets.
    IMDB Datasets: The movie dataset was sourced from IMDB's public database: IMDB Dataset.
