# ActorsBigData
project in which i wrote a program in java that uses map reduce technique and hadoop library, to count how many movies did the person take part in and how many movies did a person was a director of.
Than i use Pig to cenect the data from two diferent files, do some more map reduce tasks in which i limit myself to top 3 highest scores, conect tables and sum sets.
I used imdb movies dataset https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/, project was run succesfully on google cloud platform , with a included script.
